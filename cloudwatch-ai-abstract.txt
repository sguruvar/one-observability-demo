Title: Unified Observability for AI Agents and Traditional Workloads with Amazon CloudWatch

Abstract: Modern applications combine AI agents with traditional software components, creating hybrid systems requiring unified monitoring. This session demonstrates using Amazon CloudWatch to observe your complete application stackâ€”from AI agent decision-making and behavior patterns to traditional infrastructure metrics like CPU and memory usage. Learn practical techniques for tracking AI agent performance alongside existing application monitoring, correlating issues between AI components and traditional services, and using CloudWatch's search capabilities to identify problems quickly. We'll show how customers use CloudWatch Application Signals to maintain reliability when AI agents interact with conventional workloads, streamlining troubleshooting across hybrid environments.
